# CCC-2019-J5
My solution to CCC 2019 J5 while I was learning about classes and nodes in python.

Earned 7/15 points. My program was too slow for the remaining 8 points. 

I solved this problem with a "brute force" search and I feel like I could make a much more efficient and neater solution now than this one which I made 6 months ago.
